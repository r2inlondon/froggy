# Froggy Game

Froggy is an award winning arcade game from 80s. I built a clone of this game using pure vanilla Javascript, CSS and html.

The player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill.

The only player controls are computer keyboard's arrow keys used to navigate the frog.
